	System account // under 100 or 500-1000 uid
	Service account //eg. nginx

sudo mandb
	: create database to use apropos

apropos -s 1,8 directo
	: commands in man page is usually in 1 and 8 only
	
apropos -s 5
	: configuration files

What section of the manual pages deals with System administration commands?
	: section 8

We are trying to run apropos ssh command to get some details about the commands related to ssh but we are getting this error
	: sudo mandb

stat [filename]
	: command that show stats of file

ln source destination (-s for soft link/symbolic link)
	: create hardlink of a file ONLY, also only from the same filesystem
	: can create softlink of directories and files from other filesystems

readlink
	: to see path stored in a soft link

ls --full-time
	: list the full time craeted modified etc

find . -perm /4000
	: find files based on permission

find -perm 664 -- finds files with exactly 664 perms
			   -- -664 finds files with AT LEAST 664 perms
			   -- /664 finds files with ANY of these perms
find /usr/share/ -name '*.jpg'
	: find all files with .jpg extension

find /lib64/ -size +10M
	: find all files with size larger than 10mb

find -mtime 2
	: list files modified within the last 48-72 hours, interval of 24hrs

find \( -name "f*" -o -size 512k \)
	: find name with or with size
	: without -o is AND version

ctime vs mtime in find 
	: ctime is the change in metadata eg., date modified, mtime is changes in file contents

cat | tac(view in reverse order)

tail -n 20 /path/to/file.txt (prints last 20 lines)
	: default is last 10 lines
	: tail -F /var/log/secure //live view of a log file -F follow

head -n 20 /path/to/file.txt
	prints first lines, default still 10

sed 's/change_from/change_to/g' /path/to/file.txt
	: stands for stream editor
	: if ran WITHOUT '-i', it will only print changes, not apply it to file

sort sample.txt | uniq
	: prints only unique words, if uniq only is used, will only remove same words nga nagsunod, that's why need sort first

cat /etc/os-release
	: get info of os release

REGULAR EXPRESSION (stuck at ':', grep won't include chars after the symbol)
	^ : the line begins with
	$ : the line ends with
	. : match ANY ONE character
	* : match the previous element 0 or more times (eg., let* will match both legal and letter)
	+ : match the previous element 1 or more times
	{}: previous element can exist THIS MANY times
		0{3,} matches 3 zeros at least
		10{,3} is 1 followed by at most 3 zeros
		0{3} matches exactly 3 zeros
		0{1,4} at least once, at most 4, kinda like 0{min,max}
	? : previous element can exist once or not at all | makes the previous element optional
	| : match one thing or the other
	[]: range or sets like [a-z] [0-9] [A-Z] [a-Z]
		egrep -r 'c[au]t' /file will match cut,cat
	(): subexpression, kinda like a wrapper
	[^] : negated range or sets
		egrep -r 'http[^s]' /file will match any http, httpd,httpa except https
	
BASH Syntax	Purpose
"${values[@]}"	All values in the array
"${!values[@]}"	All indexes of the array
"${#values[@]}"	Number of elements in the array

Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system module
	: press down arrow to interrupt grub boot process, this will show the available kernels, for rhel 8
   @: mount | grep /sysroot
   	: mount -o remount rw /sysroot
   	: cd /sysroot
   	: chroot /sysroot
   	: passwd root
   	: touch /.autorelabel
   	: exit; reboot

   	: for rhel 9, go to 2nd line change r\o to r\w and then add init=/bin/bash after quiet in 3rd line
   	: passwd 
   	: touch /.autorelabel
   	: exec /sbin/init

Install, configure and troubleshoot bootloaders
	: Troubleshoot
	: 1
	: chroot /mnt/sysroot
	: grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg // for BIOS based
	: grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg // for EFI based
	: lsblk // check where to install grub /boot
	: grub2-install /dev/sda -- for EFI -- dnf reinstall grub2-efi grub2-efi-modules shim
	: exit
	: exit
	: sudo vim /etc/default/grub
	: sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
	: sudo systemctl reboot

	: /etc/default/grub file is read by mkconfig, not grub itself
	: grub will look for grub.cfg in /boot





top
	: equivalent to task manager in windows

ps
	: list processes
	: ps 1 //lists process id 1
	: ps u 1 //lists user oriented format
	: ps -U vincent //lists process by the user
	: ps u -U vincent //lists user oriented process by the user
	: ps l //show nice values
	: ps fax //forest view, parent process, child process, or ps faux

pgrep
	: grep for processes
	: pgrep -a syslog //sample

nice
	: can be used to assign priority to a process
	: niceness of a process to other processes
	: values -20 to +19, only root can assign negative number
	: nice -n 11 bash
	processes inherit the niceness value of the process that run them
	: sudo renice 7 8019 //reassign niceness/priority to a process using their PID
	: can lower niceness one time per session only if regular user, can raise as many times as we want


exit
	: type exit to exit a previous bash shell, good to know

kill
	: send signal to a process
	: default signal is 15. sigterm
	: pkill -KILL bash //use pkill for name based killing of process, use kill for PID based

Ctrl + Z when editing vi
	: brings the vi process to the background
	: type "fg" meaning foreground to get back to the background process

ampersand(&) in the end of command will run the command in the background, example use would be backing database which takes too much time

jobs
	: used to check if we have any programs running in the background
	: use "fg 1" with job number to bring the program forward, or in foreground
	: use "bg 1" to resume stopped programs

lsof -p 8401
	: stands for list open files -p process
	: run pgrep -a bash //to get PID of the process
	: then lsof -p 8401
	: ip permission denied, means the process is owned by another user or by root, use sudo to see
	: sudo lsof /var/log/messages //check what command is using the file/has used

logging daemon
	: collect organize and store logs

rsyslog which stands for rocket-fast system for log processing (a logging daemon)
	: stores all its logs in /var/log
	: ssh logs are in /var/log/secure
	: system log files are in /var/log/messages

journalctl
	: journalctl /bin/bash // show logs made generated this command -- run "which bash" first to get path, press "q" to quit
	: journalctl -u sshd.service // show logs of a service -- "u" stands for unit
	: journalctl -p + 2 tabs will show all options // "p" is for priority
	: journalctl -p info -g '^b' // use grep in journalctl
	: journalctl -S 02:00 // "S" stands for since, show logs since 2:00
	: journalctl -S 01:00 -U 02:00
	: journalctl -S also supports dates with format (2021-11-16 12:04:55) and must be wrapped in single qoutes
	: journalctl -b 0 // show logs of current boot -- -1 to show logs of previous boot
	: mkdir /var/log/journal // make the directory to make journal daemon save its journals to disk
	: using journalctl requires you to login as root or your current user to be in the adm or wheel group

last
	: command to see who last logged in to the system
	: newest entry is at the top, not the bottom

lastlog
	: shows when each user last logged in to the system

TuneD
	: used on high throughput systems, low latency, and power saving
	: 2 types.. power saving profile, performance-boosting profile, balanced profile is default
	steps
		: sudo yum install tuned -y
		: sudo systemctl enable --now tuned
		: systemctl status tuned
		: (optional) tuned-adm active
		: (optional) tuned-adm verify
		: /usr/lib/tuned //location of profiles
		: main config file is in /etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf
		: tuned-adm list
		: tuned-adm profile balanced //to switch profile
		: tuned-adm profile_info //see profile info
		: tuned-adm recommend //recommends profile
		: tuned-adm auto_profile //tuned will auto profile sytem
		: tuned-adm profile_mode //shows profile selection mode
		: tuned-adm profile balanced powersave //tuned will merge profiles based on the given options
		: dynamic tuning config file located at /etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf
		: restart tuned.service after changing config file


To display all available PVs and check which ones are used by LVM, execute:

sudo lvmdiskscan

RAID allows you to combine multiple storage devices into one logical storage unit to either boost capacity or improve data redundancy.

RAID 0 does not provide any redundancy. If any single disk fails, all data in the array is lost.

VFAT file systems are typically created with either a 12-bit or 16-bit file allocation table. To support partitions larger than 2GB, include the -F 32 flag, which creates a 32-bit file system. With a 4096-byte sector size, this configuration can theoretically support partitions up to 16 terabytes.

VDO optimizes storage use through three key techniques: zero-block filtering, deduplication, and compression.

VDO enhances storage performance by filtering out unnecessary data, eliminating redundant blocks, and compressing data in real time.

best practice is to use systemctl reload-or-restart instead or restart or reload
to completely disable auto starting of service, best practice is to use MASK instead of DISABLE because other programs can still start it


add local repo to yum for local enterprise packages
sudo yum install yum-utils
sudp yum-config-manager --add-repo https://blabla.repo // or 192.1.1.220/sample.repo

To enable an optional repository, use its repo ID:
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms

Alternatively, use yum-utils with the yum-config-manager tool:
sudo yum-config-manager --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms

package module streams
sudo yum module list
sudo yum module install nodejs:14/development
