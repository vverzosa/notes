/** NEED TO REVIEW SELINUX https://notes.kodekloud.com/docs/Red-Hat-Certified-System-AdministratorRHCSA/Manage-Security/List-and-Identify-SELinux-file-and-process-contexts **/
The xFusionCorp Industries security team recently did a security audit of their infrastructure and came up with ideas to improve the application and server security. They decided to use SElinux for an additional security layer. They are still planning how they will implement it; however, they have decided to start testing with app servers, so based on the recommendations they have the following requirements:

Install the required packages of SElinux on App server 3 in Stratos Datacenter and disable it permanently for now; it will be enabled after making some required configuration changes on this host. Don't worry about rebooting the server as there is already a reboot scheduled for tonight's maintenance window. Also ignore the status of SElinux command line right now; the final status after reboot should be disabled.

Solution:

SSH to server
sudo yum install selinux* -y
Edit /etc/selinux/config file, change:
SELINUX=disabled

There is some data on Nautilus App Server 2 in Stratos DC. Data needs to be altered in several of the files. On Nautilus App Server 2, alter the /home/BSD.txt file as per details given below:
a. Delete all lines containing word code and save results in /home/BSD_DELETE.txt file. (Please be aware of case sensitivity)
b. Replace all occurrence of word and to them and save results in /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt file.
Note: Let's say you are asked to replace word to with from. In that case, make sure not to alter any words containing the string itself; for example upto, contributor etc.

Solution:
sed '/code/d' /home/BSD.txt > /home/BSD_DELETE.txt
sed 's/and/them/g' /home/BSD.txt > /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt

During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner. The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance. These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login.
Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located at /home/thor/nautilus_banner on jump host

Solution: 
1 - Copy banner file to all servers:
sudo scp /home/thor/nautilus_banner peter@stdb01:/home/peter
2 - SSH to the server and edit the config file:
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
3 - Uncomment the "Banner" and add the path
4 - sudo systemctl restart sshd

#6
During a routine security audit, the team identified an issue on the Nautilus App Server. Some malicious content was identified within the website code.
After digging into the issue they found that there might be more infected files. Before doing a cleanup they would like to find all similar files and copy them to a safe location for further investigation.
Accomplish the task as per the following requirements:
a. On App Server 3 at location /var/www/html/news find out all files (not directories) having .php extension.
b. Copy all those files along with their parent directory structure to location /news on same server.
c. Please make sure not to copy the entire /var/www/html/news directory content.

Solution:
ssh banner@stapp03
find /var/www/html/news -type f -iname "*.php" -exec cp --parents {} /news/ \;

xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC.
After several meetings and recommendations they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer agent and dovecot as an IMAP/POP3 server. We would like you to perform the following steps:

Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.
Create an email account kirsty@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by ksH85UJjhb.
Set its mail directory to /home/kirsty/Maildir.
Install and configure dovecot on the same server.
Solution:

ssh groot@stmail01
sudo su
yum install postfix -y
Uncomment/Edit/Add below configuration on /etc/postfix/main.conf:

myhostname = stmail01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com	
mydomain = stratos.xfusioncorp.com	
myorigin = $mydomain
inet_interfaces = all
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
mynetworks = 172.16.238.0/24, 127.0.0.0/8
home_mailbox = Maildir/
# inet_interfaces = localhost
systemctl start postfix
systemctl status postfix
useradd kirsty
passwd kirsty

yum install dovecot -y
Uncomment/Edit/Add below configuration on /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf:

protocols = imap pop3 
Uncomment/Edit/Add below configuration on /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf:

mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
Uncomment/Edit/Add below configuration on /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf:

disable_plaintext_auth = yes
auth_mechanisms = plain login
Uncomment/Edit/Add below configuration on /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf:


  unix_listener auth-userdb {
    mode = 0660
    user = postfix
    group = postfix
  }
systecmtl start dovecot
systemctl status dovecot

ssh groot@stmail01

sudo yum install postfix -y

sudo vi /etc/postfix/main.cf
-->
    myhostname = stmail01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com 
    mydomain = stratos.xfusioncorp.com  
    myorigin = $mydomain
    inet_interfaces = all
    # inet_interfaces = localhost
    mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
    mynetworks = 172.16.238.0/24, 127.0.0.0/8
    home_mailbox = Maildir/
<--

sudo enable --now postfix

sudo useradd user
sudo passwd user

There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC. The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database.
After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.
Look into the issue and fix the same.

Solution:

ssh peter@stdb01
sudo systemctl start mariadb
Above "start" command will result in error.

sudo cat /var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log
And you will see the error logs:

4-10-28 16:08:12 0 [ERROR] InnoDB: The error means mysqld does not have the access rights to the directory.
2024-10-28 16:08:12 0 [ERROR] InnoDB: Operating system error number 13 in a file operation.
2024-10-28 16:08:12 0 [ERROR] InnoDB: The error means mysqld does not have the access rights to the directory.
which suggests that there's permission errors:

sudo chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
sudo chown mysql:mysql /var/run/mariadb
sudo start systemctl mariadb

We are working on hardening Apache web server on all app servers. As a part of this process we want to add some of the Apache response headers for security purpose.
We are testing the settings one by one on all app servers. As per details mentioned below enable these headers for Apache:

Install httpd package on App Server 1 using yum and configure it to run on 5000 port, make sure to start its service.
Create an index.html file under Apache's default document root i.e /var/www/html and add below given content in it.
Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries!
Configure Apache to enable below mentioned headers:
X-XSS-Protection header with value 1; mode=block
X-Frame-Options header with value SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options header with value nosniff
Note: You can test using curl on the given app server as LBR URL will not work for this task.

Solution:

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo yum intall httpd -y
sudo sed -i 's/^Listen 80/Listen 5000/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
echo "Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries!" > /var/www/html/index.html
sudo chown apache.apache /var/www/html/index.html
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
add below to configuration file:

<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
    Header set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
    Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
</IfModule>

sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd
test headers:

curl -I http://localhost:5000

We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.
On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored at /home/*_key.asc. Use these keys to perform the following actions.

Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.
Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).
The user ID you can use is kodekloud@kodekloud.com.
Solution:

ssh natasha@ststor01
sudo su
gpg --import /home/public_key.asc
gpg --import /home/private_key.asc
Encryption:

gpg --output /home/encrypted_me.asc --encrypt --recipient kodekloud@kodekloud.com /home/encrypt_me.txt
Decryption:

gpg --output /home/decrypted_me.txt --decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc
