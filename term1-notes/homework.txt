I have an issue with this one, the command that i used didn't work in the playground but worked well in my local env. my other laptop is on dual boot, ubuntu and windows

Actually sir I don't have an answer to this one. This is the only one I don't have an answer with. The command that i used worked on my local ubuntu environment but not in the playground. I kind of skipped it and proceeded to the other tasks and I kind of forgot about it.
